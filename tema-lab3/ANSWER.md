## What happens if you apply pagination after materializing the query with .ToList()? Why is this problematic for large datasets?
### Answer:
When you apply pagination after materializing the query with `.ToList()`, the entire dataset is first loaded into memory before any pagination is applied. This means that if the dataset is large, it can lead to significant memory consumption and performance issues, as the application has to handle all the records at once.
